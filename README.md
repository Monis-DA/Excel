What Iâ€™ve Learned in Excel, Power Query & DAX
This repository showcases my journey of mastering Excel, Power Query, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). Below is an overview of the key areas I've explored and applied:**

1. Excel Skills
Basic Functions & Formulas: Mastered essential functions like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, and advanced ones such as VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and IF statements.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Used functions like TEXT functions (e.g., CONCATENATE, LEFT, RIGHT) to clean and transform data, along with handling duplicates and blank cells.
Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts: Created dynamic pivot tables to summarize and analyze large datasets, alongside pivot charts for clear data visualization.
Data Visualization: Built impactful charts and applied conditional formatting to highlight key data trends.
Automation with Macros: Recorded and customized macros to automate repetitive tasks, boosting efficiency.

2. Power Query
Data Import & Transformation: Leveraged Power Query to import and transform data from various sources (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.), preparing it for analysis.
Merging & Appending Data: Combined multiple datasets by merging and appending queries.
Data Cleaning: Applied advanced cleaning techniques such as removing duplicates, managing null values, and reshaping data (pivoting and unpivoting columns).
Automating Refresh: Set up automatic data refresh to ensure reports are always up-to-date.

3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
  
Basic DAX Functions: Used fundamental DAX functions like SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX to perform basic calculations.
Calculated Columns & Measures: Created calculated columns and measures for insights like Year-to-Date (YTD) and Moving Averages.
Time Intelligence: Applied time-based DAX functions such as DATESYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, and TOTALYTD for advanced time analysis.
Advanced DAX Functions: Mastered advanced functions like ALL, CALCULATE, REMOVEFILTERS, and RELATED to manage data relationships and contextual calculations.
KPIs: Built Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using DAX to measure business metrics and visualized them in Power BI.

5. Optimization & Automation
Optimized Power Query steps and DAX calculations to enhance performance, especially when handling large datasets.
Applied best practices to ensure clean and efficient data models, reducing report generation time.
